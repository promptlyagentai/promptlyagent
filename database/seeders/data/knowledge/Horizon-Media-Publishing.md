# **Account Risk Plan**

Horizon Media & Publishing represents a strategic publishing sector partnership with significant growth potential across subscription services, ongoing optimization, and additional brand launches. The migration success demonstrates strong execution capabilities and positions us for long-term SiteWatch engagement.

Key risk factors include:

- **Migration Timeline Pressure**: Remaining 8 brands need completion by Q3 2026; delays risk relationship strain
- **Ad Revenue Dependencies**: Performance degradation post-migration would severely damage trust
- **Editorial Stakeholder Satisfaction**: Workflow friction or publishing delays could create internal resistance
- **Budget Allocation Shifts**: Media industry uncertainty may impact discretionary spending
