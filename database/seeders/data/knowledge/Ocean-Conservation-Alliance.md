# **Account Risk Plan**

Ocean Conservation Alliance represents a mission-driven partnership with strong potential for long-term engagement through SiteWatch and additional digital initiatives. The project demonstrates our nonprofit expertise and commitment to social impact work, with excellent referral potential in the nonprofit sector.

Key risk factors include:

- **Nonprofit Budget Constraints**: Limited discretionary budget may restrict scope expansion
- **Launch Timeline for Year-End Giving**: Q2 launch critical for major fundraising season; delays would impact revenue
- **Stakeholder Consensus Challenges**: Multiple internal stakeholders require careful change management
- **Third-Party Integration Complexity**: Salesforce and Action Network integration dependencies
