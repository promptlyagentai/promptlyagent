# **Account Risk Plan**

Metropolitan State University represents a strategic higher education partnership with significant long-term potential through SiteWatch, additional digital initiatives, and referrals within the higher ed sector. The multisite platform demonstrates our capability to manage complex, decentralized organizations with diverse stakeholder needs.

Key risk factors include:

- **Stakeholder Complexity**: 200+ sites means hundreds of stakeholders; consensus and change management challenges
- **Academic Calendar Constraints**: Migration timing around semesters and enrollment cycles limits deployment windows
- **Budget Cycles**: Public university budget constraints and annual appropriations may impact scope
- **Technical Debt**: Legacy systems and integrations create migration complexity
